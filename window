By design, many Linux distributions like Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc. will add users to a group of the same group name as the user name. Thus, a user ‘tom’ is added to a group named ‘tom’.

The second part is ‘rw-‘. It for the user group ‘Home’ and group-members can:

Read the file
Write or edit the file
The third part is for the world which means any user. It says ‘r–‘. This means the user can only:

Read the file

Changing file/directory permissions in Linux Using ‘chmod’ command

Syntax:

chmod permissions filename
