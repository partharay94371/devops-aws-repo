By design, many Linux distributions like Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc. will add users to a group of the same group name as the user name. Thus, a user ‘tom’ is added to a group named ‘tom’.

The second part is ‘rw-‘. It for the user group ‘Home’ and group-members can:

Read the file
Write or edit the file
The third part is for the world which means any user. It says ‘r–‘. This means the user can only:

Read the file

Changing file/directory permissions in Linux Using ‘chmod’ command
Say you do not want your colleague to see your personal images. This can be achieved by changing file permissions.

We can use the ‘chmod’ command which stands for ‘change mode’. Using the command, we can set permissions (read, write, execute) on a file/directory for the owner, group and the world.

Syntax:

chmod permissions filename

There are 2 ways to use the command –

Absolute mode
Symbolic mode
Absolute(Numeric) Mode in Linux
In this mode, file permissions are not represented as characters but a three-digit octal number.

The table below gives numbers for all for permissions types.

Number	Permission Type	 Symbol
0	No Permission	  —
1	Execute	          –x
2	Write	          -w-
3	Execute + Write	  -wx
4	Read	           r–
5	Read + Execute	  r-x
6	Read +Write	  rw-
7	Read + Write +Execute	rwx

Let’s see the chmod permissions command in action.
